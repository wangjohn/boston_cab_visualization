# Boston Cab Visualization

This makes a heatmap of cab pick-ups for a given time of day. You can select different ranges of time using the slider.

# Questions

1. What is the message in your visualization and what techniques did you use to illustrate it?

  The message in my visualization is that taxi pickup locations change depending on the time of day. It tends to be the case that in the mornings, people get picked up in Kenmore, North Station, and in Back Bay. However, in the evening, taxis tend to pick people up near the Prudential Center, the Financial District, and near South Station.

  The heatmap gives you an idea of where people live, and where people work (depending on the time of day). The way I illustrated this was by making a heatmap and overlaying it on a map of Boston, then providing a slider to change the time range that you viewed.

2. If you used interaction or animation, how does it facilitate the user's understanding?

  I used a slider so that the user would be able to interactively decide at what times to look at something. The user was allowed to change exactly the times that he was looking at. This means that the user could look at whatever times he wanted to, and possibly find something that others would not be able to find by being confined to be predefined time range.

3. What format is the data that is used by the visualization? Is it the raw data or did you need to compute some summary or derived data product?

  The data is raw -- all I used were the latitude and longitude coordinates.
